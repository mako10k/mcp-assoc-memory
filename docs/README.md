## 💭 Core Concepts

### Associative Memory
The system automatically discovers connections between memories, helping you:
- Find related knowledge when solving problems
- Discover unexpected connections for creative thinking
- Build comprehensive understanding of complex topics
- Accelerate learning through knowledge synthesis

### Hierarchical Organization
Memories are organized in intuitive scope hierarchies:
```
work/
  ├── projects/[name]/
  ├── meetings/
  └── decisions/

learning/
  ├── [technology]/
  ├── concepts/
  └── courses/

personal/
  ├── goals/
  └── ideas/
```

### Semantic Search
Natural language search that understands meaning, not just keywords:
- "error handling patterns" finds relevant solutions
- "React performance" discovers optimization techniques
- "database scaling" uncovers architecture insights

---

## 🚀 Key Features

### ✅ Complete CRUD Operations
- **Create**: Store memories with automatic association discovery
- **Read**: Retrieve with rich context and related memories
- **Update**: Modify content, scope, and metadata
- **Delete**: Clean removal with association cleanup

### ✅ Intelligent Discovery
- **Semantic Search**: Find relevant memories using natural language
- **Association Discovery**: Explore connections between concepts
- **Scope Management**: Organize knowledge hierarchically
- **Session Isolation**: Temporary workspaces for specific projects

### ✅ Cross-Environment Sync
- **Export**: Backup memories to files or direct data transfer
- **Import**: Restore from backups with flexible merge strategies
- **Portability**: Move knowledge between development environments
- **Collaboration**: Share curated knowledge sets

### ✅ VS Code Integration
- **GitHub Copilot**: Natural language memory operations
- **Task Runner**: One-click server management
- **MCP Protocol**: Seamless tool integration
- **Development Workflow**: Embedded in coding environment

---

## 🎨 Usage Philosophy

### Quality Over Quantity
Store insights, patterns, and solutions rather than raw information. Each memory should help your future self solve problems or make decisions.

### Contextual Organization
Use scopes to reflect how you think about and organize your work. The hierarchy should feel natural and predictable.

### Association-Driven Discovery
Regularly explore connections between memories. The system's strength lies in revealing unexpected relationships between concepts.

### Workflow Integration
Embed memory operations into your existing workflows. The more naturally you use the system, the more valuable it becomes.
