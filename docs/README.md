## üí≠ Core Concepts

### Associative Memory
The system automatically discovers connections between memories, helping you:
- Find related knowledge when solving problems
- Discover unexpected connections for creative thinking
- Build comprehensive understanding of complex topics
- Accelerate learning through knowledge synthesis

### Hierarchical Organization
Memories are organized in intuitive scope hierarchies:
```
work/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ projects/[name]/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ meetings/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ decisions/

learning/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [technology]/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ concepts/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ courses/

personal/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ goals/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ideas/
```

### Semantic Search
Natural language search that understands meaning, not just keywords:
- "error handling patterns" finds relevant solutions
- "React performance" discovers optimization techniques
- "database scaling" uncovers architecture insights

## üé® Usage Philosophy

### Quality Over Quantity
Store insights, patterns, and solutions rather than raw information. Each memory should help your future self solve problems or make decisions.

### Contextual Organization
Use scopes to reflect how you think about and organize your work. The hierarchy should feel natural and predictable.

### Association-Driven Discovery
Regularly explore connections between memories. The system's strength lies in revealing unexpected relationships between concepts.

### Workflow Integration
Embed memory operations into your existing workflows. The more naturally you use the system, the more valuable it becomes.
