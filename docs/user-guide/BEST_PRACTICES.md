# Best Practices Guide - MCP Associative Memory Server

## üéØ Memory Management Best Practices

### Content Quality Guidelines

#### ‚úÖ What to Store
- **Insights and learnings** - "Discovered that async/await in Python can prevent blocking I/O"
- **Problem solutions** - "Fixed memory leak by using weak references in observer pattern"
- **Decision rationales** - "Chose PostgreSQL over MongoDB for ACID compliance requirements"
- **Code patterns** - "Builder pattern implementation for complex configuration objects"
- **Meeting outcomes** - "Team decided to migrate to microservices architecture by Q2"

#### ‚ùå What NOT to Store
- **Raw code dumps** - Store patterns and insights instead
- **Sensitive information** - Passwords, API keys, personal data
- **Temporary debugging output** - Use session scope if needed
- **Version-specific details** - Focus on concepts that transcend versions
- **Duplicate information** - The system handles some duplicates, but avoid intentional redundancy

### Scoping Strategy

#### Hierarchical Organization
```
work/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ architecture/        # System design decisions
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ debugging/          # Problem-solving insights
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ meetings/           # Meeting outcomes and decisions
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ projects/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [project-name]/ # Project-specific knowledge
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/         # Cross-project patterns
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ team/               # Team processes and learnings

learning/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [technology]/       # Technology-specific knowledge
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ patterns/           # Design patterns and architectures
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ concepts/           # Fundamental concepts
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ courses/            # Structured learning content

personal/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ goals/              # Personal objectives
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ideas/              # Creative thoughts
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reflections/        # Learning reflections
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ career/             # Career development notes
```

#### Scope Naming Conventions
- **Use consistent patterns**: `work/projects/mcp-server` not `work/mcp-project`
- **Be specific**: `learning/python/async` not `learning/programming`
- **Include context**: `work/debugging/database-performance` not `work/debugging`
- **Avoid deep nesting**: 3-4 levels maximum for readability

### Content Writing Guidelines

#### Effective Memory Content
```markdown
# Good Examples

"React useEffect with empty dependency array runs only on mount/unmount, 
equivalent to componentDidMount/componentWillUnmount in class components. 
Use this pattern for one-time setup operations."

"Database connection pooling reduces overhead by reusing connections. 
Set pool size to 2x CPU cores for I/O-bound applications. 
Monitor connection utilization to optimize pool size."

# Poor Examples

"useEffect()"  # Too brief, lacks context

"Fixed bug today"  # No detail, hard to search

"const pool = new Pool({max: 20})"  # Code without explanation
```

#### Metadata Usage
- **Tags**: Use 3-5 specific tags per memory
- **Categories**: Consistent categorization (programming, meeting, idea, bug-fix)
- **Metadata**: Add context like project names, dates, stakeholders

### Search Optimization

#### Query Strategies
1. **Start broad, then narrow**
   ```
   "database performance" ‚Üí "PostgreSQL index optimization" ‚Üí "B-tree vs GIN indexes"
   ```

2. **Use conceptual terms**
   ```
   Good: "error handling patterns"
   Poor: "try catch exception"
   ```

3. **Include context**
   ```
   Good: "React component testing with Jest"
   Poor: "testing"
   ```

#### Understanding Results
- **Similarity scores 0.4+**: Highly relevant
- **Similarity scores 0.2-0.4**: Moderately relevant, good for exploration
- **Similarity scores 0.1-0.2**: Tangentially related, useful for creative connections

### Association Discovery

#### Maximizing Connection Quality
1. **Store related concepts together** (same session)
2. **Use consistent terminology** across memories
3. **Cross-reference explicitly** when storing related thoughts
4. **Regular association exploration** to discover unexpected links

#### Creative Thinking Patterns
```instructions
# After storing several memories about a topic
"Show me unexpected connections to [specific memory]"

# For brainstorming
"Find memories related to [problem] with similarity threshold 0.2"

# For learning reinforcement  
"What concepts are related to [new learning]?"
```

## üîÑ Workflow Integration

### Daily Usage Patterns

#### Morning Routine
1. **Review yesterday's memories** - "Show me memories from yesterday"
2. **Set context for today** - Store daily goals or focus areas
3. **Check related work** - Search for relevant previous solutions

#### During Work
1. **Capture insights immediately** - Don't wait until end of day
2. **Search before solving** - Check if you've solved similar problems
3. **Store decision rationales** - Include WHY, not just WHAT

#### Evening Review
1. **Store key learnings** - What did you discover today?
2. **Export work progress** - Backup important insights
3. **Explore associations** - Find unexpected connections

### Project Workflows

#### Starting New Projects
```instructions
1. Search for similar past projects
2. Create project-specific scope: work/projects/[name]
3. Store initial requirements and constraints
4. Reference relevant patterns from previous work
```

#### During Development
```instructions
1. Store architecture decisions with rationale
2. Document non-obvious solutions
3. Capture performance insights
4. Record debugging discoveries
```

#### Project Completion

- Review and update scope structure
- Archive old session memories

#### Quarterly (30 minutes)
- Comprehensive scope review
- Export full backup
- Analyze association patterns for insights

### Quality Control

#### Memory Quality Indicators
- **Good**: Can find it later with reasonable search terms
- **Good**: Provides context for decisions
- **Good**: Helps solve similar future problems
- **Poor**: Too abstract to be useful
- **Poor**: Missing crucial context
- **Poor**: Difficult to search for

#### Scope Health Indicators

- **Logical hierarchy** - Easy to predict where content belongs
- **Searchable organization** - Can find content through scope browsing

## üöÄ Advanced Techniques

### Cross-Project Knowledge Transfer
```instructions
# When starting similar projects
"Export memories from work/projects/[similar-project]"
"Import to work/projects/[new-project] with merge strategy"
```

### Learning Acceleration
```instructions
# Connect new learning with existing knowledge
"Store this new concept and find related memories"
"Show me how this relates to [previous learning]"
```

### Team Knowledge Sharing
```instructions
# Prepare knowledge for sharing
"Export memories about [topic] for team documentation"
"Create exportable summary of [project] learnings"
```

### Performance Optimization
- **Batch related memories** during storage sessions
- **Use specific scopes** for faster searching
- **Regular exports** to maintain system performance
- **Session cleanup** to remove temporary content

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start small** - Begin with one scope, expand gradually
2. **Be consistent** - Develop personal naming conventions and stick to them
3. **Think future-you** - Write content your future self will understand
4. **Use associations** - Regularly explore connections for creative insights
5. **Export regularly** - Backup valuable knowledge frequently
6. **Review and refine** - Periodically review and improve your organization system
