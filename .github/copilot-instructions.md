# GitHub Copilot Instructions (MCP Projects)

## ‚úÖ Overview

This project implements a memory-centered LLM assistant system using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).  
Tools, memory management, and domain-aware knowledge access are key parts of the architecture.

Copilot should follow the rules below when generating or modifying code in this repository.

---

## ‚úÖ General Rules

- üîç **Always refer to actual implementation**, not assumptions. Check code before proposing changes.
- üß± **Use strict typing**: all inputs and outputs must follow the defined types.
- üìÑ **Respect existing structure**: follow the current file/module layout and naming conventions.
- üîÅ **Prefer reuse**: Do not reimplement normalization, validation, or formatting logic ‚Äî use utilities if they exist.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not guess** CLI flags, config structure, or environment variables ‚Äî check usage in entrypoints or config loaders.
- ‚úÖ If unsure, suggest a verification method (e.g. "Check how Config is loaded in main.ts").

---

## ‚úÖ When Handling MCP Tools

- Each tool handler uses a `mode`-based dispatch. Always validate `mode` before branching.
- On errors, always return `data: {}` or a known-safe structure. Avoid `undefined` values.
- Tool responses must follow the MCP JSON-RPC spec:
  ```json
  {
    "success": true | false,
    "message": "...",
    "error": "...",
    "data": {}
  }
  ```
- `parameters` is the correct schema field for tools ‚Äî **not** `inputSchema` (except for legacy Inspector compatibility).

---

## ‚úÖ Style and Project Conventions

- üß™ Tests: Use Jest or the built-in test framework. Organize in `tests/unit/` or `tests/integration/`.
- üßæ Typing: Use strict, JSON-compatible types. Avoid `any` unless explicitly required.
- üìÅ Directory structure:
  ```
  src/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/        # Logic (memory, projects, similarity, etc.)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ transport/   # HTTP/STDIO/SSE servers
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ handlers/    # Tool implementations
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/       # Schema definitions
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/       # Shared helpers
  ```

---

## ‚úÖ Error Handling Guidelines

- Use a shared `errorResponse()` helper for all tool errors.
- Always include a defined `data` field in responses.
- Do not return raw exceptions; extract message and type.

Example:

```ts
return errorResponse("VALIDATION_ERROR", "Missing 'content' field", { content: "" });
```

---

## ‚úÖ CI Expectations

- All code must pass type checking, linting, and unit tests before merge.
- Coverage should remain above 80% for core modules.
- Copilot should suggest tests alongside new code if none exist.

---

## ‚úÖ Prompt Design for Copilot

If code behavior seems unclear, prompt Copilot with:

```
- What type does this function expect?
- What existing utilities handle X?
- Where is config loaded in this project?
- What should a valid tool response look like?
```

---

## üß© Tips

- MCP Inspector requires `inputSchema` only for older versions ‚Äî default to `parameters` and mirror it if needed.
- Always test changes using a real `tools/call` or `tools/list` JSON-RPC request, not just code shape.

## üìã Current Project Status & Next Steps

**üîó For detailed current status and immediate todos, see: [CURRENT_STATUS_AND_TODO.md](../CURRENT_STATUS_AND_TODO.md)**

### Quick Context (Updated: 2025-07-09)
- **FastMCP 2.0 migration**: ‚úÖ Complete
- **Associative memory features**: ‚úÖ Restored (embedding-based search, similarity calculation)
- **Core architecture**: ‚úÖ Integrated (MemoryManager, EmbeddingService, ChromaVectorStore)
- **Next priority**: üîß Dependency verification, initialization stabilization, basic testing

**Important**: This project's core requirement is **associative memory functionality** - semantic similarity search and automatic association discovery between memories. Always maintain these capabilities.

## ‚úÖ Terminal and Output Handling

**Note**: When using terminal commands, be aware of potential output display issues:

- **Terminal Output Bug**: The `run_in_terminal` tool may sometimes not display output properly
- **Workaround**: For critical commands, use output redirection: `command 2>&1 | tee /workspaces/mcp-assoc-memory/.copilot-temp/{task_name}-00001.log`
- **Alternative**: Use `script` command for complex scenarios that need full terminal emulation
- **Verification**: If terminal output appears empty, check the generated log files in `.copilot-temp/` directory
- **Best Practice**: Always verify command execution results through file system checks or direct file reading when output is missing
- **File Naming**: Use simple task names with 5-digit sequence numbers (e.g., `chroma-test-00001.log`), always ending with `.log`

## üìù Note on Instruction Organization

This section was added to consolidate user-provided instructions. All relevant guidance has been integrated into the appropriate sections above to maintain consistency and clarity for LLM interactions.
