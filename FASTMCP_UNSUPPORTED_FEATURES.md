# FastMCP Unsupported Features

## Overview

This document lists features that were planned or partially implemented in the legacy MCP implementation but are not supported or cannot be implemented with FastMCP 2.0.

## Deleted/Removed Features

### 1. Authentication System (`auth/` directory)
- **Status**: Removed during FastMCP migration
- **Original Implementation**: JWT tokens, API keys, session management
- **Reason for Removal**: FastMCP does not provide built-in authentication mechanisms
- **Alternative**: Authentication should be handled at the client/transport layer

### 2. Custom Transport Layer (`transport/` directory)
- **Status**: Removed during FastMCP migration  
- **Original Implementation**: Custom HTTP, SSE, STDIO handlers with routing
- **Reason for Removal**: FastMCP provides its own transport handling
- **Alternative**: Use FastMCP's built-in transport capabilities

### 3. Visualization System (`visualization/` directory)
- **Status**: Removed during FastMCP migration
- **Original Implementation**: HTML/CSS/JS memory graph visualization
- **Reason for Removal**: Complex UI components not suitable for MCP tool paradigm
- **Alternative**: Export data for external visualization tools

### 4. Complex Tool Handler Architecture (`handlers/` directory)
- **Status**: Removed during FastMCP migration
- **Original Implementation**: Modular tool routing with base classes
- **Reason for Removal**: FastMCP uses decorator-based tools
- **Alternative**: Direct function definitions with FastMCP decorators

## Features Not Implemented

### 1. Multiple Tool Modes/Actions
- **Status**: Not implemented in FastMCP version
- **Original Plan**: Subcommand-style tools (e.g., `memory` with `store`, `search`, `get` actions)
- **Current Implementation**: Separate tools for each function (`memory_store`, `memory_search`, etc.)
- **Reason**: FastMCP encourages single-purpose tools for better LLM interaction

### 2. Project Management System
- **Status**: Not implemented
- **Original Plan**: Multi-user project collaboration with member management
- **Required Components**: 
  - Project creation/deletion
  - Member management (add/remove users)
  - Project-specific memory domains
  - Permission systems
- **Reason**: Complex feature requiring authentication and multi-tenancy

### 3. Session Management
- **Status**: Not implemented
- **Original Plan**: Temporary memory scopes for conversation sessions
- **Required Components**:
  - Session creation/deletion
  - Session-specific memory isolation
  - Session switching
- **Reason**: Requires stateful session tracking not suitable for MCP

### 4. Advanced Memory Management
- **Status**: Partially implemented
- **Missing Features**:
  - Memory importance weighting
  - Usage-based priority updates
  - Automatic memory archiving
  - Batch operations (bulk store/delete)
  - Memory export/import
- **Reason**: Complex features requiring additional development time

### 5. Real-time Updates and SSE Streaming
- **Status**: Not implemented
- **Original Plan**: Real-time memory updates via Server-Sent Events
- **Reason**: FastMCP tools are request-response based, not streaming

### 6. Advanced Search Features
- **Status**: Not implemented
- **Missing Features**:
  - Tag-based filtering
  - Time range searches
  - Complex query combinations
  - Search result ranking
- **Current**: Basic semantic similarity search only

### 7. Memory Analytics and Statistics
- **Status**: Basic implementation via resources
- **Missing Features**:
  - Detailed usage analytics
  - Memory access patterns
  - Performance metrics
  - Historical statistics
- **Current**: Basic memory count and domain statistics

### 8. Graph Database Integration
- **Status**: Not implemented
- **Original Plan**: Neo4j integration for complex relationship mapping
- **Current**: Simple in-memory associations
- **Reason**: Additional infrastructure complexity

### 9. Backup and Recovery System
- **Status**: Not implemented
- **Original Plan**: Automated backup, restore, and data migration tools
- **Missing Features**:
  - Scheduled backups
  - Point-in-time recovery
  - Data migration between environments
- **Reason**: Infrastructure feature outside MCP scope

### 10. Admin Tools
- **Status**: Not implemented
- **Original Plan**: Administrative tools for system maintenance
- **Missing Features**:
  - Health monitoring
  - Performance tuning
  - User management
  - System diagnostics
- **Reason**: Administrative features not suitable for LLM tool interface

## Recommendations

### For Missing Core Features
1. **Project Management**: Implement as external service with MCP integration
2. **Authentication**: Handle at client/infrastructure level
3. **Advanced Search**: Extend current search tool with additional parameters
4. **Session Management**: Use client-side session tracking

### For Advanced Features
1. **Visualization**: Export data for external tools (Gephi, Cytoscape, D3.js)
2. **Analytics**: Implement as separate monitoring service
3. **Real-time Updates**: Use polling-based approaches with client-side state management
4. **Backup/Recovery**: Implement as system-level scripts

### Development Priorities
1. **Phase 1**: Enhance current core tools (search, memory management)
2. **Phase 2**: Add data export capabilities
3. **Phase 3**: Develop external services for complex features
4. **Phase 4**: Create client libraries for common patterns

## Conclusion

The FastMCP migration successfully simplified the architecture and focused on core memory functionality. While some advanced features were lost, the current implementation provides a solid foundation for memory-based LLM applications. Complex features should be implemented as complementary services rather than MCP tools.
